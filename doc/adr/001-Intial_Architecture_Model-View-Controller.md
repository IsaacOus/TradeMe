## _Trade Me_

# 1. Intial_Architecture_Model-View-Controller.md

Date: 2022-01-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to create an application from scratch that fit the requirements, and we should make an architecture choice.  
Given the short time we had at our disposal, we chose to opt for a simple architecture.
It will represent our basic architecture and over time we will enhance the existing.


## Decision

Model-View-Controller architecture. 


## Consequences

- Minimum valuable product quickly deployed
- Well separated Layer
- Less scalable
- Difficult to test
- Strongly coupled
